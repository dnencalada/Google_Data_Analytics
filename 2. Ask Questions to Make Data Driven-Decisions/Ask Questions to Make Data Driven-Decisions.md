## Asking effective questions
In the ask step, we define the problem we're solving and make sure that we fully understand stakeholder expectations.
Learn how to craft effective questions that help you collect the right data to solve those problems.

**Structured thinking**: The process of recognizing the current problem or situation, organizing available information, revealing gaps and opportunities, and identifying the options.



### From issue to action: The six data analysis phases
##### Step 1: Ask
It’s impossible to solve a problem if you don’t know what it is. These are some things to consider:
-   Define the problem you’re trying to solve
-   Make sure you fully understand the stakeholder’s expectations
-   Focus on the actual problem and avoid any distractions
-   Collaborate with stakeholders and keep an open line of communication
-   Take a step back and see the whole situation in context

Questions to ask yourself in this step:
1.  What are my stakeholders saying their problems are?
2.  Now that I’ve identified the issues, how can I help the stakeholders resolve their questions?

##### Step 2: Prepare
You will decide what data you need to collect in order to answer your questions and how to organize it so that it is useful. You might use your business task to decide: 
-   What metrics to measure
-   Locate data in your database
-   Create security measures to protect that data

Questions to ask yourself in this step: 
1.  What do I need to figure out how to solve this problem?
2.  What research do I need to do?

##### Step 3: Process
Clean data is the best data and you will need to clean up your data to get rid of any possible errors, inaccuracies, or inconsistencies. This might mean:
-   Using spreadsheet functions to find incorrectly entered data
-   Using SQL functions to check for extra spaces
-   Removing repeated entries 
-   Determining if your data is biased 

Questions to ask yourself in this step: 
1.  What data errors or inaccuracies might get in my way of getting the best possible answer to the problem I am trying to solve?
2.  How can I clean my data so the information I have is more consistent?


##### Step 4: Analyze
You will want to think analytically about your data. At this stage, you might sort and format your data to make it easier to: 
-   Perform calculations
-   Combine data from multiple sources
-   Create tables with your results

Questions to ask yourself in this step:
1.  What story is my data telling me?
2.  How will my data help me solve this problem?
3.  Who needs my company’s product or service? What type of person is most likely to use it?

##### Step 5: Share
Everyone shares their results differently so be sure to summarize your results with clear and enticing visuals of your analysis using data viz tools like graphs or dashboards. This is your chance to show the stakeholders you have solved their problem and how you got there. Sharing will certainly help your team: 
-   Make better decisions
-   Make more informed decisions
-   Lead to stronger outcomes
-   Successfully communicate your findings

Questions to ask yourself in this step:
1.  How can I make what I present to the stakeholders engaging and easy to understand?
2.  What would help me understand this if I were the listener?


##### Step 6: Act
Now it’s time to act on your data. You will take everything you have learned from your data analysis and put it to use. This could mean providing your stakeholders with recommendations based on your findings so they can make data-driven decisions.

Questions to ask yourself in this step:
1.  How can I use the feedback I received during the share phase (step 5) to actually meet the stakeholder’s needs and expectations?


These six steps can help you to break the data analysis process into smaller, manageable parts, which is called **structured thinking**. This process involves four basic activities:
1.  Recognizing the current problem or situation
2.  Organizing available information 
3.  Revealing gaps and opportunities
4.  Identifying your options



> ***An example:*** Anywhere Gaming Repair company want to make ads, it should consider:
> different advertising startegies(target audiences); budget;
> 
> **Ask**: collaborating with stakeholders and understanding their needs, defining the problem that needed to be solved: not knowing their target audience's preferred type of advertising.
> **Prepare**: collected data on the different advertising methods.
> **Process**: cleaned the data to eliminate any errors or inaccuracies. when you clean data, you transform it into a more useful format, create more complete information, and remove outliers.
> **Analyze**: First, who's most likely to own a video gaming system? And second, where are these people most likely to see an advertisement? Learned that both TV commercials and podcasts are very popular with people in the target audience(18-34 years old).
> **Share**: summarized her results using clear and compelling visuals of the analysis.
> **Act**:  Anywhere Gaming Repair took action. They worked with a local podcast production agency to create a 30-second ad about their services.

### 6 Basic problem types
Understanding what kind of problem you are trying to solve.

![](https://github.com/dnencalada/Google_Data_Analytics/blob/main/Images/image6.png)

#### Making predictions
A company that wants to know the best advertising method to bring in new customers is an example of a problem requiring analysts to make predictions.
#### Categorizing things
Analysts might classify customer service calls based on certain keywords or scores, to improve customer satisfaction.
#### Spotting something unusual
A company that sells smart watches that help people monitor their health would be interested in designing their software to spot something unusual.
Could involve a data analyst examining why a dataset has a surprising and rare data point. Spotting something unusual deals with identifying and analyzing something out of the ordinary.
#### Identifying themes
Categorizing things involves assigning items to categories. Identifying themes takes those categories a step further, grouping them into broader themes. In User experience(UX) study, user beliefs, practices, and needs are examples of themes.
#### Discovering connections
A third-party logistics company working with another company to get shipments delivered to customers on time is a problem requiring analysts to discover connections.
#### Finding patterns
Minimizing downtime caused by machine failure is an example of a problem requiring analysts to find patterns in data. For example, by analyzing maintenance data, they might discover that most failures happen if regular maintenance is delayed by more than a 15-day window.
Finding patterns deals with identifying trends in a data set.

### SMART questions
How to ask effective questions that lead to key insights you can use to solve all kinds of problems?

#### SMART methodology
![](https://github.com/dnencalada/Google_Data_Analytics/blob/main/Images/image7.png)
- **S**pecific
Specific questions are simple, significant, and focused on a single topic or a few closely related ideas.
- **M**easurable
Measurable questions can be quantified and assessed. 
- **A**ction-oriented
Action-oriented questions encourage change. (Ask questions that bring answers you can act on.)
- **R**elevant
Relevant questions matter, are important, and have significance to the problem you're trying to solve.
- **T**ime-bound
Time-bound questions specify the time to be studied.

#### Things to avoid when asking questions
*Bad questions:*
- **Leading question**: questions that lead you to answer in a certain way.
Example: "This product is too expensive, isn’t it?" -->
"What price (or price range) would make you consider purchasing this product?"
- **Close-ended question**: questions that ask for a one-word or brief response only. (Rarely lead to valuable insights. Questions should be open-ended.)
Example: "How was the customer trial?" --> 
"Tell me about the customer experiences from the trial."
- **Vague questions**: questions that aren’t specific or don’t provide context
Example: "Does that tool work for you?" -->
"When it comes to data entry, how much time does the tool save you?"

> Fairness also important to keep in mind when carfting questions.
> (**Fairness**: ensuring that your questions don't create or reinforce bias.)
> A common example of an unfair question is one that makes assumptions. Unfair questions assume the respondent’s answer to the question.
> e.g. "These are the best sandwiches ever, aren't they?"
> (An unfair question because it was phrased to lead you toward a certain answer)


#### A "deep dive" example
Your manager asks you to perform a "deep dive" into the data about their weekend sales.
-   **Objectives**: What are the goals of this deep dive? What, if any, questions are expected to be answered?
-   **Audience**: Who are the stakeholders? Who is interested or concerned about the results of this deep dive? Who will you be presenting to?
-   **Time**: What is the time frame for completion? By what date does this need to be done?
-   **Resources**: What resources are available to accomplish the deep dive's goals?
-   **Security**: Who should have access to the information?



#### Asking real world questions
##### Step 1: Planning
Start by taking a few minutes to think about who you are going to speak with, and what types of SMART questions would make sense to ask based on their field.
-   **S**pecific: Questions are simple, significant, and focused on a single topic or a few closely related ideas.
-   **M**easurable: Questions can be quantified and assessed.
-   **A**ction-oriented: Questions encourage change.
-   **R**elevant: Questions matter, are important, and have significance to the problem you’re trying to solve. 
-   **T**ime-bound: Questions specify the time to be studied.

##### Step 2: Creating questions
Overall, your goal is to come up with questions to help you understand more about the data the individual usually interacts with, limitations of the data they have, and their business goals. 
-   **Avoid technical jargon.** 
-   **Prioritize your questions**: Ask the most important and impactful questions first to save time.
-   **Make your time count**: Stay on subject during the conversation.
-   **Clarify your understanding**: To avoid confusion, briefly summarizing the given answers to make sure you understood it correctly. This will go a long way in helping you avoid mistakes.
"Just to double check that I understand what you’re saying correctly, you currently use grading data in the following ways…"

##### Step 3: Take good notes!
Remember, if a question is worth asking, then the answer is worth recording. At a minimum, good notes include:
-   **Facts:** Any concrete piece of information is usually worth writing down. Dates, times, names, and other specifics that pop up.
-   **Context:** Facts without context are useless. Note any relevant details that are needed in order to understand the information you gather.
-   **Unknowns:** Sometimes you may miss an important question during a conversation. Make a note when this happens so you know to figure out the answer later.

For example, if we had a conversation with an ice cream shop about collecting data on customer flavor preferences, our notes might appear something like this:
-   **Project**: Collect customer flavor preference data.
-   **Overall business goal**: Use data to create more popular flavors.
-   **Two data sources**: Cash register receipts and completed customer surveys (email).
-   **Target completion date:** Q2 
-   **To do:** Call back later and speak with the manager about the location of survey data.



## Making data-driven decisions

### The power of data
Data analysis can help us make more informed decisions.

Businesses and other organizations use data to make better decisions all the time. There's two ways they can do this:
- **Data-driven decision-making**: Using facts to guide business strategy.
- **Data-inspired decision-making**: Explores different data resources to find out what they have in common. (commonalities)

**Algorithm**: a process or set of rules to be followed for a specific task.

When data is interpreted incorrectly, it can lead to huge losses:
Coke launch failure, Mars orbiter loss
When accurate data and success meet:
Video streaming success, Fast food on-the-go

#### Qualitative and Quantitative data
**Quantitative data**: specific and objective measures of numerical facts.
    The what? How many? How often? (Things you can measure)
 
 **Qualitative data**: subjective or explanatory measures of qualities and characteristics
    Why? (Can't be measured with numeric data)

![](https://github.com/dnencalada/Google_Data_Analytics/blob/main/Images/image8.png)


   
### Reports and Dashboards
Two data presentation tools: report and dashboard. Both is useful for data visualization.

#### Report
> **Report**: Static collection of data given to stakeholders periodically.
> 
> *Pros:*
 >   - High-level historical data
 >   - Easy to design
>    - Pre-cleaned and sorted data
>
> *Cons:*
> - Continual maintenance
> - Less visually appealing
> - Static
>
> **Pivot table**: A data summarization tool that is used in data processing.
> A pivot table can automatically summarize, sort, reorganize, group, count, total or average data stored in one table or spreadsheet, displaying the results in a second table showing the summarized data.
> (e.g. In Google sheets, click Data--> Pivot table)

#### Dashboard

> **Dashboard**: Monitors live, incoming data.
> 
> *Pros:*
> - Dynamic, automatic and interactive
> - More stakeholder access
> - Low maintenance
>
> *Cons:*
> - Labor-intensive design
> - Can be confusing
> - Potentially uncleaned data

##### The benefits of using a dashboard 
The benefits of using a dashboard for both data analysts and their stakeholders:
    
| **Benefits**       | **For Data Analysts**                                                                      | **For Stakeholders**                                                                              |
|:------------------ |:------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |:------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Centralization** | Sharing a single source of data with all stakeholders                                      | Working with a comprehensive view of data, initiatives, objectives, projects, processes, and more |
| **Visualization**  | Showing and updating live, incoming data in real time*                                     | Spotting changing trends and patterns more quickly                                                |
| **Insightfulness** | Pulling relevant information from different datasets                                       | Understanding the story behind the numbers to keep track of goals and make data-driven decisions  |
| **Customization**  | Creating custom views dedicated to a specific person, project, or presentation of the data | Drilling down to more specific areas of specialized interest or concern                           |

> *It is important to remember that changed data is pulled into dashboards automatically only if the data structure is the same. If the data structure changes, you have to update the dashboard design before the data can update live.*

##### A process to creat a dashboard
1. Identify the stakeholders who need to see the data and how they will use it.
Ask effective questions. Check the [Requirements Gathering Worksheet](https://s3.amazonaws.com/looker-elearning-resources/Requirements+Gathering+Worksheet.pdf "This link takes you to a requirements gathering worksheet published by Looker.") to explore a wide range of good questions you can use to identify relevant stakeholders and their data needs..
2. Design the dashboard (what should be displayed)
Make your dashboard design clear, easy to follow, and simple:
- Use a clear header to label the information
- Add short text descriptions to each visualization
- Show the most important information at the top
3. Create mock-ups if desired
a lot of data analysts like to sketch out their dashboards before creating them
4. Select the visualizations you will use on the dashboard
To learn more about choosing the right visualizations, check out Looker’s short course on [designing great dashboards](https://training.looker.com/designing-great-dashboards "This link takes you to a Looker training course called Designing Great Dashboards.").
- For more samples of area charts, column charts, and other visualizations, visit [Tableau’s Viz Gallery](https://www.tableau.com/solutions/gallery "This link takes you to the Tableau Viz Gallery where you can view sample dashboards.").
- Explore [Tableau’s Viz of the Day](https://public.tableau.com/en-us/gallery/?tab=viz-of-the-day&type=viz-of-the-day "This link takes you to the Tableau's Viz of the Day page that is updated daily.") to see visualizations curated by the community.
5. Create filters as needed
Filters show certain data while hiding the rest of the data in a dashboard. To dig deeper into filters and find an example of filters in action, you can visit Tableau’s page on [Filter Actions](https://help.tableau.com/current/pro/desktop/en-us/actions_filter.htm "This link takes you to a Tableau Help page describing how to create a filter.").

##### Types of dashboards
1.  **Strategic**: *Focuses on long term goals and strategies at the highest level of metrics.*
These dashboards provide information over the longest time frame — from a single financial quarter to years.
![](https://github.com/dnencalada/Google_Data_Analytics/blob/main/Images/image9.png)
2.  **Operational:** *Short-term performance tracking and intermediate goals.*
Arguably, the most common type of dashboard. Containing information on a time scale of days, weeks, or months, and they can provide performance insight almost in real-time.
![](https://github.com/dnencalada/Google_Data_Analytics/blob/main/Images/image10.png)
3.  **Analytical:** *Consists of the datasets and the mathematics used in these sets.*
Analytical dashboards contain the details involved in the usage, analysis, and predictions made by data scientists. Rarely shared with upper management as they can be very difficult to understand.
![](https://github.com/dnencalada/Google_Data_Analytics/blob/main/Images/image11.png)



### Data versus metrics
**Metric**: Single, quantifiable type of data that can be used for measurement.
e.g.
Using key performance indicators(KPI), such as click-through rates, to measure revenue;
Using annual profit targets to set and evaluate goals.

**Metric Goal**: A measurable goal set by a company and evaluated using metrics.

**ROI(Return on Investment)** = the net profit over a period of time / the cost of investment


### Big and small data
Small data involves a small number of specific metrics over a shorter period of time. It’s effective for analyzing day-to-day decisions.
Big data involves larger and less specific datasets and focuses on change over a long period of time. It’s effective for analyzing more substantial decisions.

**Small data:**
Specific, Short-time period, Day-to-day decisions

**Big data:**
Large and less-specific, Long time-period, Big decisions

Big data e.g. 
Bed Occupancy Rate = $\frac{\text { Total \# of inpatient days for a given period } \mathbf{X} 100}{(\text { Available beds } \mathbf{X} \# \text { of days in the period) }}$


#### Differences between big and small data

| Small data                                                   | Big data                                                     |
| :----------------------------------------------------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------- |
| Describes a data set made up of specific metrics over a short, well-defined time period | Describes large, less-specific data sets that cover a long time period |
| Usually organized and analyzed in spreadsheets               | Usually kept in a database and queried                       |
| Likely to be used by small and midsize businesses            | Likely to be used by large organizations                     |
| Simple to collect, store, manage, sort, and visually represent | Takes a lot of effort to collect, store, manage, sort, and visually represent |
| Usually already a manageable size for analysis               | Usually needs to be broken into smaller pieces in order to be organized and analyzed effectively for decision-making |

#### Challenges and benefits of big data
Here are some **challenges** you might face when working with big data:

-   A lot of organizations deal with data overload and way too much unimportant or irrelevant information. 
-   Important data can be hidden deep down with all of the non-important data, which makes it harder to find and use. This can lead to slower and more inefficient decision-making time frames.
-   The data you need isn’t always easily accessible. 
-   Current technology tools and solutions still struggle to provide measurable and reportable data. This can lead to unfair algorithmic bias. 
-   There are gaps in many big data business solutions.

Now for the good news! Here are some **benefits** that come with big data:

-   When large amounts of data can be stored and analyzed, it can help companies identify more efficient ways of doing business and save a lot of time and money.
-   Big data helps organizations spot the trends of customer buying patterns and satisfaction levels, which can help them create new products and solutions that will make customers happy.
-   By analyzing big data, businesses get a much better understanding of current market conditions, which can help them stay ahead of the competition.
-   As in our earlier social media example, big data helps companies keep track of their online presence—especially feedback, both good and bad, from customers. This gives them the information they need to improve and protect their brand.


#### The  four V words for big data

| Volume             | Variety                     | Velocity                           | Veracity                                |
| :----------------- | :-------------------------- | :--------------------------------- | :-------------------------------------- |
| The amount of data | The different kinds of data | How fast the data can be processed | The quality and reliability of the data |



## Spreadsheet basics
### Working with spreadsheets
**Some common math functions:**
Sum, Average, Count, Min, Max

**Spreadsheet tasks**
The first steps a data analyst takes when working with data in a spreadsheet are to sort and filter the data.
Data analysts use formulas and functions to save time and effort by automating commands.
- Organize your data
    - Pivot table
        - Sort and filter
- Calculate your data
    - Formulas
    - Functions

#### Spreadsheets and the data life cycle
The relationship of using spreadsheets and the data life cycle: **plan, capture, manage, analyze, archive,** and **destroy**.
![](https://github.com/dnencalada/Google_Data_Analytics/blob/main/Images/image12.jpg)

- **Plan** for the users who will work within a spreadsheet by developing organizational standards.
This can mean formatting your cells, the headings you choose to highlight, the color scheme, and the way you order your data points.
- **Capture** data by the source by connecting spreadsheets to other data sources, such as an online survey application or a database.
- **Manage** different kinds of data with a spreadsheet.
This can involve storing, organizing, filtering, and updating information, who can access the data, how the information is shared, and how to keep your data safe and secure.
- **Analyze** data in a spreadsheet to help make better decisions.
Spreadsheet analysis tools include formulas to aggregate data or create reports, and pivot tables for clear visuals.
- **Archive** any spreadsheet that you don’t use often, but might need to reference later with built-in tools.
- **Destroy** your spreadsheet when you are certain that you will never need it again, if you have better backup copies, or for legal or security reasons.

### Using formulas
Formula is a set of instructions that performs a specific calculation. Basic, they can do math (and something more) for you.

#### Mathematical operators
Formulas are based on operators. The formulas will usually include at least one operator.
**Operator**: A symbol that names the type of operation or calculation to be performed.

In spreadsheet, you start a formula with an `=` sign followed by the rest of the expression without any spaces.

#### Referencing
**Cell reference**: A cell or a range of cells in a worksheet that can be used in a formula.
Contains the letter of the column and the number of the row where the data is.

**Range**: A collection of two or more cells.
Can include cells from the same row or column, or from different columns and rows collected together.
Click into the formula, or press the F2 (or Enter) key to highlight the range of data referenced in a formula.

##### Relative references
Relative references (which is what you normally do e.g. "=A10") will change anytime the formula is copied and pasted.
They are in relation to where the referenced cell is located.

##### Absolute referencing
Absolute referencing is marked by a dollar sign (\$). For example, =\$A\$10 has absolute referencing for both the column and the row value.
Absolute references will not change when you copy and paste the formula in a different cell.

> For example if you copied “=A10” to the cell to the right it would become “=B10”. With absolute referencing “=\$A\$10” copied to the cell to the right would remain “=\$A\$10”. But if you copied \$A10 to the cell below, it would change to \$A11 because the row value isn't an absolute reference.
> 
> To easily switch between absolute and relative referencing in the formula bar, highlight the reference you want to change and press the F4 key.


> Combining with functions:
> `COUNTIF()` is a formula and a function. This means the function runs based on criteria set by the formula.
> For example, you could use `=COUNTIF(A1:A16, “7”)` to count only the cells that contained the number 7.

#### Spreadsheet errors and fixes
Helpful tips:
1.  Filter data to make your spreadsheet less complex and busy.
2.  Use and freeze headers so you know what is in each column, even when scrolling.
3.  Create a tab with just the raw data, and a separate tab with just the data you need.

**Common spreadsheet errors:**

| Error     | Description                                                                                              | Example                                                                                                                                             |

##### `#DIV/0!`
A `#DIV/0!` error means that your formula is trying to divide a value in a cell by 0, or by an empty cell (with no value).
You can delete that row but a better option is to fill `N/A` automatically.
Change the formula from `=C4/B4\*100` to `=IF(B4, C4/B4*100, "N/A")`:
![](https://github.com/dnencalada/Google_Data_Analytics/blob/main/Images/image13.jpg)

##### `#ERROR!` or `#NULL!`
Means that you have specified two or more cell ranges without a comma as the delimiter to separate them.
*Fixing the error:*
`=COUNT(B1:D1,C1:C10)` instructs the spreadsheet to count the number of values from cell B1 through cell D1 and from C1 through C10.
`=SUM(B2:B6,C2:C6)` instructs the spreadsheet to add the values in cell B2 through cell B6 and from cell C1 through cell C6.

##### `#N/A`
The data in your formula or function can’t be found by the spreadsheet. This error most often occurs when you are using functions like `VLOOKUP` to look up a value in a spreadsheet based on matching criteria.
![screenshot of columns B and C](https://d3c33hcgiwev3.cloudfront.net/imageAssetProxy.v1/apMBwQNSS-iTAcEDUrvotQ_27a59a9fcd154783a0994d37bb192340_Lookup-Table-2.png?expiry=1619308800000&hmac=W7WM8xo0q5KMiSchh1yWhhd-m14YjidJFbkg8JOmCBU)
In the spreadsheet above, use `=VLOOKUP("Almond", $B$4:$C$6, 2, 0)` will return `#N/A` cuz Almond doesn't exist. Should use "Almonds".

> `VLOOKUP(search_key, range, index, [is_sorted])`
> *Vertical lookup. Searches down the first column of a range for a key and returns the value of a specified cell in the row found.*
> e.g. `VLOOKUP(10003, A2:B26, 2, FALSE)`
> **search_key**:   The value to search for. For example, 42, "Cats", or B24.
> **range**:    The range to consider for the search. The first column in the range is searched for the key specified in search_key.
> **index**:    The column index of the value to be returned, where the first column in range is numbered 1.
> **is_sorted**\[optional\]:  Indicates whether the column to be searched (the first column of the specified range) is sorted, in which case the closest match for search_key will be returned.


##### `#NAME?`
Check the spelling in your formula or function.
e.g. `=VLOOOKUP` have an extra O.

##### `#NUM!`
Can’t perform a calculation as specified.
The numbers might be too big or small for the spreadsheet to process, the calculation might be impossible, or there is something wrong with the variables that have been input.

e.g. the spreadsheet can’t execute the DATEDIF formula because the Start Date is after the End Date:
![](https://github.com/dnencalada/Google_Data_Analytics/blob/main/Images/image14.jpg)


##### `#REF!`
Your formula or function is referencing a cell that is no longer valid. A cell (or range of cells) may be missing because it was deleted.
![](https://github.com/dnencalada/Google_Data_Analytics/blob/main/Images/image15.jpg)
If you delete row 4:

##### `#VALUE!`
A general error.

### Using functions
A function is a preset command that automatically performs a specific process or task using the data.
e.g. : SUM, AVERAGE, COUNT, MIN, MAX

After input like `Min(` then you can drag to select the range you want.

> **Difference between formulas and functions:**
> -   A formula is a statement written by the user within a spreadsheet application.
> -   A function is a predefined operation built into the spreadsheet application.

#### Shortcuts
Keyboard shortcuts like cut, save, and find are actually functions.

## Save time with structured thinking
Data analysts aren't always given the complete picture at the start of a project. A big part of their job is to develop a structured approach and use critical thinking to find the best solution. That starts with understanding the problem domain, where structured thinking comes into play.

**Problem domain**: The specific area of analysis that encompasses every activity affecting or affected by the problem.


**Structured thinking**: The process of recognizing the current problem or situation, organizing available information, revealing gaps and opportunities, and identifying the options.

In order to save time and money, a data analyst defines the problem domain, key milestones, and timeline at the start of a project.
In other words, it's a way of being super prepared. It's having a clear list of where you are expected to deliver, a timeline for major tasks and activities, and checkpoints so the team knows you're making progress.

The starting place for structured thinking is the problem domain

### Scope of work
Now, you will consider a valuable tool to help you practice structured thinking and avoid mistakes: a scope-of-work (SOW).
A well-defined SOW keeps you, your team, and everyone involved with a project on the same page.

**Scope of work(SOW)**: An agreed-upon outline of the work you're going to perform on a project.
Foundational pieces of SOW: deliverables, milestones, timeline, reports
e.g.  For a weddign invitation:
     Deliverables: Invitation options, List and addresses of invitees, Printed invitations, Adressed envelopes, Stamps, Mailing
    
#### foundational pieces
At a minimum, any SOW should answer all the relevant questions in the following areas. Note that these areas may differ depending on the project:
1. **Deliverables**: What work is being done, and what things are being created as a result of this project?
Avoid vague statements and be specific.
2. **Milestones**: What are the major milestones for progress in your project?
3. **Timeline**: The timeline is a way of mapping expectations for how long each step of the process should take. Your timeline will be closely tied to the milestones you create for your project. 
4. **Reports**: Good SOWs also set boundaries for how and when you’ll give status updates to stakeholders.
How will you communicate progress with stakeholders and sponsors, and how often?

#### in- and out-of-scope
SOWs should also contain information specific to what is and isn’t considered part of the project.
The "scope" of your project is everything that you are expected to complete or accomplish, defined to a level of detail that doesn’t leave any ambiguity or confusion about whether a given task or item is part of the project or not.
It’s important to be as specific as possible in these documents, and to use quantitative statements whenever possible.

*An example structure of SOW:*
- Data Analyst name, Client/Sponsor(name)
- Purpose
- Scope / Major Project Activities
- This project does not include
- Deliverables
- Schedule Overview / Major Milestones (Milestone, Expected Completion Date, Description)
- Estimated date for completion


### Context and bias
As a data analyst, a big part of your job, is putting data into context.
A data analyst asks who, what, when, where, why, and how in order to put information into context.
contextualizing data, and recognizing data bias
Putting data into context helps data analysts eliminate bias.

**Context**: The condition in which something exists or happes.

It's good to ask yourself questions like, who collected the data? And what is it about? What does the data represent in the world, and how does it relate to other data? When, was the data collected? Where, was the data collected? And of course, why. The why can have a particularly strong relationship with bias.

> ***The importance of context***
> Contextual information makes a big difference and it can turn raw data into meaningful information.
> It is very important for data analysts to contextualize their data. To do this, you need to identify:
> -   When the data was created or collected
> -   How it was created or collected
> -   Where it came from
> -   Who funded the collection, if that is the case
> -   The motivation behind the collection
> -   The other things in the world that data could have an impact on



## Always remember the stakeholder
### Balancing needs and expectations across your team
**Turnover rate**: The rate at which employees leave a company.

*Three things you can focus on that will help you stay on task:*
1. Who are the primary and secondary stakeholders? 
2. Who is managing the data? 
3. Where can you go for help?

Focusing on stakeholder expectations enables data analysts to understand project goals, improve communication, and build trust.

### Working with stakeholders
**Stakeholders**: people that have invested time, interest, and resources into the projects that you'll be working on as a data analyst.
In other words, they hold stakes in what you're doing.


#### Different stakeholders
*Three common stakeholder groups that you might find yourself working with: *
the executive team, the customer-facing team, and the data science team.

##### Executive team
The executive team provides strategic and operational leadership to the company. Might include vice presidents, the chief marketing officer, and senior-level professionals who help plan and direct the company’s work.
They are less interested in the details. Time is very limited with them, so make the most of it by leading your presentations with the answers to their questions. You can keep the more detailed information handy in your presentation appendix or your project documentation.

##### Customer-facing team
Includes anyone in an organization who has some level of interaction with customers and potential customers.
These stakeholders have their own objectives and may come to you with specific asks. It is important to let the data tell the story and not be swayed by asks from your stakeholders to find certain patterns that might not exist.

##### Data science team
Working with other data analysts, data scientists, and data engineers.
A big part of your job will be collaborating with other data team members to find new angles of the data to explore. Here's a view of how  different roles on a typical data science team support different functions:

#### Tips on working effectively with stakeholders
Use the following tips to communicate clearly, establish trust, and deliver your findings across groups.
- **Discuss goals**: Stakeholder requests are often tied to a bigger project or goal. When they ask you for something, take the opportunity to learn more. Start a discussion. Ask about the kind of results the stakeholder wants.
- **Feel empowered to say “no**.” Stakeholders don’t always realize the time and effort that goes into collecting and analyzing data. They also might not know what they actually need. You can help stakeholders by asking about their goals and determining whether you can deliver what they need. If you can’t, have the confidence to say "no," and provide a respectful explanation. If there’s an option that would be more helpful, point the stakeholder toward those resources.
You should feel empowered to say no-- just remember to give context so others understand why.
- **Plan for the unexpected.** Before you start a project, make a list of potential roadblocks. Then, when you discuss project expectations and timelines with your stakeholders, give yourself some extra time for problem-solving at each stage of the process.
- **Know your project.** Keep track of your discussions about the project over email or reports, and be ready to answer questions about how certain aspects are important for your organization.
- **Start with words and visuals.** It is common for data analysts and stakeholders to interpret things in different ways while assuming the other is on the same page. To help avoid this, start with a description and a quick visual of what you are trying to convey.
- **Communicate often.** Your stakeholders will want regular updates on your projects. Share notes about project milestones, setbacks, and changes. Then use your notes to create a shareable report. Another great resource to use is a change-log, which is a file containing a chronologically ordered list of modifications made to a project.

### Balancing expectations and realistic project goals
Setting realistic stakeholder expectations might involve creating a reasonable timeline, communicating any changes that may affect analysis, and preparing a report that shows the pros and cons of a project update.

**Set a reasonable and realistic timeline** 
(By communicate with your stakeholders about the questions at the beginning of the project.)
Your stakeholders will know what to expect when, and you won't be overworking yourself and missing deadlines because you overpromised.

**Flag problems early for stakeholders**
When run into problems, which might add time to your data processing and cleaning and delay some project milestones. You 'll want to let your project manager know and maybe work out a new timeline to present to stakeholders.
When request changes, communicate the obstacles so they can decide if it's worth changing at this stage of the project. You might prepare a report on how their request changes the project timeline or alters the model. You could also outline the pros and cons of that change.

**Set realistic expectations at every stage of the project**
Balance stakeholder expectations and what's possible with the projects, resources, and limitations.

> Sometimes people think that data can answer everything and sometimes we have to acknowledge that that is simply untrue.



### Clear communication
*Before you communicate, think about:*
- Who your audience is
- What they already know
- What they need to know
- How you can communicate that effectively to them

Good communication keeps stakeholders updated on progress and ultimately helps prevent problems.

#### Tips for effective communication
You might find yourself feeling a little out of sync with the rest of your team and how they communicate when you start at a new job, that's totally normal. You'll figure things out in no time if you're willing to learn as you go and ask questions.

e.g. acronyms:TL;DR   Don't be afraid to ask if you don't know.

Every work setting has some form of etiquette: eye contact, handshake, bow.

*Email writing skills:*
- Practice good writing habits; (make your email professional and easy to understand. Write complete sentences that have a proper spelling and punctuation)
- Read your emails out loud; (to hear if they make sense and catch any typos)
A good rule of thumb: would you be proud of what you had written if it were published on the front page of a newspaper? If not, revise it until you are.
- Don't be too long. Be clear and concise, and add TLDR.
If you need a response in something specific from one of your team members, be clear about what you need and when you need it so that they can get back to you.
- Answer in a timely manner.
For example, try to answer emails in 24~48 hours, even if it's just to give them a timeline for when you'll have the actual answers they're looking for. That way you can set expectations and they know I'm working on it.
For example, include a date in the subject line and bold dates in the body of the email so it's really clear.

##### Effective communication strategies
*Important first tip*: **Know your audience!** Be sure to answer these four important questions related to your audience:
1.  Who is your audience?
2.  What do they already know?
3.  What do they need to know?
4.  How can you best communicate what they need to know?

###### Project example
Assume you're a data analyst working at a company that develops mobile apps.
- Who is your audience?
Kiri, Product Development Project Manager
- What do they already know?
Kiri received updates about our project from its planning stages, including the most recent project report, sent two weeks ago.
- What do they need to know?
Kiri needs an update on the analysis project’s progress and needs to know that the executive team approved changes to the data and timeline. You know that adding a new variable to the analysis will impact the current project timeline. Kiri will need to change the project’s milestones and completion date.
- How can you best communicate what they need to know?
You can start by sending an email update to Kiri with the latest timeline for the project, but a meeting might be necessary if she wants to talk through her concerns about missing a deadline.

*Updated timeline email sample:*
After answering the audience questions, you have the key building blocks you need to write an email to Kiri. Here's an example of how these questions can help organize the flow of the email message:

### Recognize data limitations
Quick answer might not be the most accuracy one. To ensure their work answers the right questions and delivers useful results, the data analyst reframes a question; outline the problem, challenges, potential solutions, and timeframe.
A data analyst would use these techniques in order to put data into context, balance speed with accuracy, and keep stakeholders informed.

***Questions to ask to weighs the outcomes and actions of your analysis:***
Speed can sometimes affect accuracy. That's why you need a solid process that weighs the outcomes and actions of your analysis. This starts with questions:

- Does your analysis answer the original question? 
- Are there other angles you haven't considered? 
- Can you answer any questions that may get asked about your data and analysis? 
- How detailed should you be when sharing your results? 
- Would a high level analysis be okay?

Asking questions enables data analysts to consider the best ways to share data with others, help their team make informed decisions, and use data to get to a solid conclusion.

#### Limitations of data
- ***The case of incomplete(or nonexistent!) data***
If you have incomplete or nonexistent data, you might realize during an analysis that you don't have enough data to reach a conclusion.
If a sample size is too small, a few unusual responses can skew the results. To avoid this problem, data analysts aim to collect lots of data and chart trends over longer time periods.

- ***Don't miss misaligned data***
If you're collecting data from other teams and using existing spreadsheets, it is good to keep in mind that people use different business rules.
Establishing how to measure things early on standardizes the data across the board for greater reliability and accuracy. This will make sure comparisons between teams are meaningful and insightful.

- ***Deal with dirty data***
Dirty data refers to data that contains errors. Dirty data can lead to productivity loss, unnecessary spending, and unwise decision-making. A good data cleaning effort can help you avoid this. As a quick reminder, data cleaning is the process of fixing or removing incorrect, corrupted, incorrectly formatted, duplicate, or incomplete data within a dataset.

- ***Tell a clear story***
Great tips for data analysts in his [blog: Occam's Razor](http://www.kaushik.net/). Below are some of the best practices he recommends for good data storytelling:
    -   **Compare the same types of data**: Data can get mixed up when you chart it for visualization. Be sure to compare the same types of data and double check that any segments in your chart definitely display different metrics. 
    -   **Visualize with care**: A 0.01% drop in a score can look huge if you zoom in close enough. To make sure your audience sees the full story clearly, it is a good idea to set your Y-axis to 0.
    -   **Leave out needless graphs:** If a table can show your story at a glance, stick with the table instead of a pie chart or a graph. Your busy audience will appreciate the clarity.
    -   **Test for statistical significance:** Sometimes two datasets will look different, but you will need a way to test whether the difference is real and important. So remember to run statistical tests to see how much confidence you can place in that difference.
    -   **Pay attention to sample size**: Gather lots of data. If a sample size is small, a few unusual responses can skew the results. If you find that you have too little data, be careful about using it to form judgments. Look for opportunities to collect more data, then chart those trends over longer periods.

- ***Be the judge***
In any organization, a big part of a data analyst’s role is making sound judgments. When you know the limitations of your data, you can make judgment calls that help people make better decisions supported by the data. Data is an extremely powerful tool for decision-making, but if it is incomplete, misaligned, or hasn’t been cleaned, then it can be misleading. Take the necessary steps to make sure that your data is complete and consistent. Clean the data before you begin your analysis to save yourself and possibly others a great amount of time and effort.


### Teamwork and meetings
Meetings make it possible for you and your team members or stakeholders to discuss how a project is going. Whether they're virtual or in person, team meetings can build trust and team spirit.
Regular meetings also make it easier to coordinate team goals.


#### Do and Don't of a meeting
*Best practices you can follow to make sure your meetings are a success:*
- **Do**
    - **Come prepared**
        - Bring what you need, like pen, notebook;
        - Read the meeting agenda;
        - Prepare your notes and presentations (if you're leading a meeting)
        - Be ready to answer questions (if you're leading a meeting)
    - **Be on time**
            When you're the person leading the meeting, make sure you build and send out an agenda beforehand.
    - **Pay attention**
    - **Ask questions**
            When you need clarification, or if you think there may be a problem.
            Don't be afraid to reach out after a meeting.
            
- **Don't**
    - **Show up unprepared**
    - **Arrive late**
    - **Be distracted**
    - **Dominate the conversation**
    - **Talk over others**
    - **Distract people with unfocused discussion**

When leading a meeting, testing out technology, taking notes and preparing supporting materials will help you ensure all participants have a positive experience.

#### Leading great meetings
**Before the meeting**
If you are organizing the meeting, you will probably talk about the data. Before the meeting: 
-   Identify your objective. Establish the purpose, goals, and desired outcomes of the meeting, including any questions or requests that need to be addressed.
-   Acknowledge participants and keep them involved with different points of view and experiences with the data, the project, or the business.
-   Organize the data to be presented. You might need to turn raw data into accessible formats or create data visualizations. 
-   Prepare and distribute an agenda. We will go over this next.

**Crafting a compelling agenda**
A solid meeting agenda sets your meeting up for success. Here are the basic parts your agenda should include: 
-   Meeting start and end time
-   Meeting location (including information to participate remotely, if that option is available)
-   Objectives 
-   Background material or data the participants should review beforehand

Here's an example of an agenda for an analysis project that is just getting started:
![](https://github.com/dnencalada/Google_Data_Analytics/blob/main/Images/image20.jpg)

**Sharing your agenda ahead of time**
After writing your agenda, it's time to share it with the invitees. Sharing the agenda with everyone ahead of time helps them understand the meeting goals and prepare questions, comments, or feedback. You can email the agenda or share it using another collaboration tool.

**During the meeting**
As the leader of the meeting, it's your job to guide the data discussion. With everyone well informed of the meeting plan and goals, you can follow these steps to avoid any distractions:
-   Make introductions (if necessary) and review key messages
-   Present the data 
-   Discuss observations, interpretations, and implications of the data
-   Take notes during the meeting
-   Determine and summarize next steps for the group

**After the meeting**
To keep the project and everyone aligned, prepare and distribute a brief recap of the meeting with next steps that were agreed upon in the meeting. You can even take it a step further by asking for feedback from the team.
-   Distribute any notes or data 
-   Confirm next steps and timeline for additional actions
-   Ask for feedback (this is an effective way to figure out if you missed anything in your recap)

**A final word about meetings**
Even with the most careful planning and detailed agendas, meetings can sometimes go off track. An emergency situation might steal people’s attention. A recent decision might unexpectedly change requirements that were previously discussed and agreed on. Action items might not apply to the current situation. If this happens, you might be forced to shorten or cancel your meeting. That is alright, just discuss anything that impacts your project with your manager or stakeholders and reschedule your meeting after you have more information.



#### From conflict to collaboration
A conflict can pop up for a variety of reasons.
Best way to flip the situation:
- **Reframe the problem**
Instead of focusing on what went wrong or who to blame, try asking, how can I help you reach your goal? This creates an opportunity for you and your team members to work together to find a solution instead of feeling frustrated by the problem. 
- **Start a conversation**
Discussion is the key. Ask things like, are there other important things I should be considering?
But if you find yourself feeling emotional, give yourself some time to cool off so you can go into the conversation with a clearer head.
"If I need to write an email during a tense moment, I'll actually save it to drafts and come back to it the next day to reread it before sending to make sure that I'm being level-headed."
- **Understand the context**
If you find you don't understand what your team member or stakeholder is asking you to do, ask what their end goal is, what story they're trying to tell with the data or what the big picture is. Doing additional research and asking questions are effective ways to determine how to proceed with a new project.
